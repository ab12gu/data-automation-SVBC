# Notes:

## Current Issues

- Handwritten participation sheets need to be digitalized into Salesforce


## Potential Tasks/Solutions

        - Create or find tool to give user option to edit individual text conversions based on confidence level

- Find alternate tool to Zapier to transfer eventbrite info to salesforce
- Fix Zapier to work with prior automation method
- Create new tool to automate data transfer between two systems
